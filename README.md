# Amorphous Laundry
## :question: About
Amorphous Hotel is a conceptual laundry services provider providing washing and dry-cleaning services built with Vue.js. It is a course outcome of the online Vue.js Bootcamp from Hexschool. It is also a part of the artist residency project in Eaton HK (Amorphous Hotel) which discusses human needs, particularly its relation to architecture and sensory. Amorphous Hotel will be launched in mid-2022 as another virtual platform responding to this Amorphous Laundry project.

I worked as a web developer and a UI/UX designer for this project.
